# ForecastingSharePrices
This is my work for my final project.
My attempt is to forecast share prices using various models for given dataset. 
Then comparing their accuracies and finding the best model for short term prediction. 
I have chosen 5 methods - `ARIMA, RandomForest, MLP, Holt-Winters and Genetic Algorithm`
Dataset has been taken from NIFTY50 from NSE India Website.
Method of comparison is by taking their MSE and MAPE and comparing them.
